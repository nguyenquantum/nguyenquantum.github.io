I'll soon graduate and move, so today I sold my beloved guitars who were always there with me during my good and bad times at MIT... Hope they stay safe and continue brightening the lives of their new owners. :)

* Donner DCG-1 sold to Random Hall's music room
* Yamaha FG800 sold to fellow Random resident Shion M.
* Epiphone Les Paul special II sold to fellow Random resident Wells C.
* (This is a keyboard) Casio CTK-3500 61-Key sold to Random head of house Laurie, 

Well, I'll by new guitars at my new place and continue rocking, of course!
