I am currently focusing on quantum information, quantum complexity, and quantum error correction.

My publications are on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&user=vTYawOEAAAAJ)

Some other exploratory papers I've written:

* [Random circuit sampling](https://nguyenquantum.github.io/Random_circuit_sampling.pdf) and quantum computational advantange (aka quantum supremacy)

* [Area laws](https://nguyenquantum.github.io/Area_laws.pdf) in quantum many-body physics

<!-- * [Sample complexity separation](https://nguyenquantum.github.io/equivariant.pdf) between equivariant (aka group convolutional) and fully connected neural networks (with [Bobak Kiani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fz1mq4AAAAAJ&hl=en))

* [Learning quantum error-correcting codes](https://nguyenquantum.github.io/Wasserstein.pdf) using the quantum Wasserstein-1 distance
 -->
<!-- * [Tight-binding method](https://nguyenquantum.github.io/tight-binding.pdf) for band structure calculation
 -->
<!-- Lecture notes:
* To be uploaded -->
