I do research in quantum computation and quantum information theory. Other fields that I often foray into include theoretical computer science and machine learning theory.

My publications are on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&user=vTYawOEAAAAJ)

Some exploratory papers I wrote:

* [Random circuit sampling](https://nguyenquantum.github.io/Random_circuit_sampling.pdf)

* [Area laws](https://nguyenquantum.github.io/Area_laws.pdf)
